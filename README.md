## Requirements
* node `^5.0.0`
* yarn `^0.23.0` or npm `^3.0.0`

```bash
$ yarn  # Install project dependencies (or `npm install`)
```

## Running the Project

```bash
$ yarn start  # Start the development server (or `npm start`)
```

While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:

|`yarn <script>`    |Description|
|-------------------|-----------|
|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:3000`|
